<!-- CDN stands for Content Delivery Network. 
A CDN is a network of servers that are spread out across the world and cache content close to end users. 
This helps to speed up the delivery of web content, especially for data-heavy applications, and can also help to prevent issues like buffering, poor image and sound quality, and incomplete transmissions.

CDNs can also help to load balance traffic, which can prevent routers or servers from becoming overwhelmed. This can be especially important for e-commerce retailers during peak traffic periods, when customers expect fast product image load times and quick transactions. 
CDNs can also provide other benefits, such as:
Security: CDNs can help to protect websites from DDoS attacks
Availability: CDNs can ensure that data is provided by the server at all times
Bandwidth costs: CDNs can save on bandwidth costs by delivering data to the closest client
