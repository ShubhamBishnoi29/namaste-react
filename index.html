<!-- CDN stands for Content Delivery Network. 
A CDN is a network of servers that are spread out across the world and cache content close to end users. 
This helps to speed up the delivery of web content, especially for data-heavy applications, and can also help to prevent issues like buffering, poor image and sound quality, and incomplete transmissions.

CDNs can also help to load balance traffic, which can prevent routers or servers from becoming overwhelmed. This can be especially important for e-commerce retailers during peak traffic periods, when customers expect fast product image load times and quick transactions. 
CDNs can also provide other benefits, such as:
Security: CDNs can help to protect websites from DDoS attacks
Availability: CDNs can ensure that data is provided by the server at all times
Bandwidth costs: CDNs can save on bandwidth costs by delivering data to the closest client

<!-- 
    bundler are-> webpack, parcel, vite
    bundler basically its bundles your app or packages your app properly so that you can
    shift to production level.  -->

<!-- create-react-app behind the sence uses webpack which is bundler -->

<!-- 
        two types dependencies:-
        dev-dependecies- required when we are developing the app
        dependencies-> the dependencies are used in production also -->

<!-- 
            npm install -D parcel
            installing it as dev-dependencies -->

<!-- ========== -->
<!-- package.json is configuration for our npm -->

<!-- package.lock.json -> keep a track of every exact version which is installed as dependencies.
intergity in package.lock.json-> it is a hash which keep track on production

package.json -> keep the track of approximate version

node_modules-> It contains all the code that we fetched from npm    (it u=is a collection of packages) -->

<!-- transitive-depndecies-> suppose parcel is installed so it has also other dependencies to it. -->

<!-- if you have package and package.lock json you can create all your nodemodules. -->

<!-- what we can regenerate we should put it in .gitignore -->

<!-- carat(^) -> it gives minor updates
dilda(~) -> it gives major updates -->
<!-- 
npm -> for installing the packages
npx -> for running or execute the package -->

<!-- 
"main": "App.js" -> It tells us that it is the entry point for our app
but when we run build command "npx parcel build index.html" in terminal
it will five error because here we are making build throug index.html.
So, remove "main": "App.js" from package.json -->


<!-- In package.json on https://browserslist.dev/?q=bGFzdCAxMCB2ZXJzaW9ucw%3D%3D
"browsersList": [
    "last 10 versions"
] -->

<!-- npm start is euivelent to npm run start  -> it is only possible for start command because it is resvered by npm -->
